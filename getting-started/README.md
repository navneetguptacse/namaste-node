# Getting Started

Welcome to **Namaste Node**!

This guide will help you set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navneetguptacse/namaste-node.git
   cd getting-started
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

Start the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Application source code
- `package.json` — Project metadata and scripts

## Description

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to Node.js development. Through this getting-started guide, you will gain a solid understanding of:

- Setting up a Node.js project and running it locally
- Creating a simple HTTP server
- Connecting to a MongoDB database

This foundation will prepare you for more advanced Node.js concepts and real-world application development.

## Important Note

While this getting-started guide covers core Node.js modules (such as the built-in HTTP module and MongoDB native driver), we will transition to more modern and simplified approaches in subsequent tutorials.

However, I strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with these fundamental packages and understanding how they work. This knowledge will give you a solid grasp of Node.js basics, even though we'll later adopt popular frameworks and libraries like Express.js and Mongoose for server creation, API development, and database operations.
